Project Name: Nepotism Tracker

Team Members: Insha Lakhani, Arnav Ghatiwala, Sanya Shetty

Project Description: Our project aims to determine the relationship between the amount of nepotism present in the
Bollywood industry and the success of such actors who are heavily affected by nepotism. We represent nepotism with
connectedness in our graph, such that actors who are part of larger connected components represent those who are more
likely to be subject to nepotism as they have more connections. In terms of software, we have various classes which
serve to web scrape the Wikipedia and Rotten Tomatoes websites, as well as an implementation of the BFS algorithm in
order to traverse the graph that we create based on the scraped data. Using the data that was collected and analyzed
using our code, we created a written report detailing our findings.

Concepts used: The first concept we used was Document Search (aka Information Retrieval), which was utilized when web
scraping to gather data from the Wikipedia pages and the Rotten Tomatoes website. The second concept we used was Graph
and graph algorithms, through which we used the BFS algorithm in order to analyze our graph and determine its
connectedness as well as how connected individual nodes in the graph were to each other.

Work Breakdown: Arnav worked on the Wikipedia webscraping to create a list of Bollywood actors and actresses as well as
adjacency lists for each of them, Insha worked on the Rotten Tomatoes webscraping to create a mapping of each actor and
actress to their average movie rating and average box office sales, and Sanya worked on the BFS implementation in order
to determine the overall number of connected components in the graph as well as the size of each actor's connected
component. Then, Insha worked on a regression model to analyze the data that was collected while Arnav and Sanya
wrote and organized the final report.
