# nepotism_tracker
### About
This was the NETS 150 Final Project for Arnav Ghatiwala, Sanya Shetty, and Insha Lakhani. Curious about the rising nepotism in Bollywood,
we built this project to apply the concepts used in class to real-life data. The code includes files that have methods to scrape data about
all Bollywood celebrities, their relatives, and the performance of their movies. Subsequently, we build a graph where each celebrity is a node
and two nodes share an edge if the celebrities are related. Then, we conduct Breadth-First Search to count the number of connected components
in the graph. The limited number of connected components compared to the number of actual celebrities showed the extent of nepotism in the
industry.
